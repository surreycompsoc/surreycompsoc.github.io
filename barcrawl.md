Come along to our Icebreaker barcrawl, in 3 simple steps!

## Step 1: Buy a ticket!

Tickets are Â£7, and include access to all venues (including Flirt at Rubix!) and a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks deals.

To purchase, go to the **[Union 'Buy Products' page (link here)](https://www.ussu.co.uk/activity/Pages/BuyProducts.aspx)**. Their site is notoriously bad on mobile, so maybe get to a PC to avoid pulling your hair out. Log in, and find the 'CompSoc Icebreaker Barcrawl', add it by pressing the '>' button, and pay securely.

If you get 'This service is unavailable' then you'll have to try again later, the Union site is being rubbish.

When you see 'Please wait... The Authorisation was Successful', you don't have to wait, because it's done, the Union website is just bad. You can close the tab.

## Step 2: Tell us your shirt size!

Use **[this Google form (link)](https://goo.gl/forms/BD9M3UupZvuVY7Dx2)** to tell us your size, so we can order you the right shirt. Shirts can be collected the day before the crawl (along with voucher books for 'spoons)

## Step 3: RSVP on Facebook!

If you haven't already, head to our **[Facebook event (link)](https://www.facebook.com/events/1833719126848859/)** and mark that you're going!

## Where are we going?

Here's the plan:

* Hari's Bar 19:00-19:45
* Spoons 20:00-21:00
* King's Head 21:15-22:00
* Pop World 22:15-23:00
* Rubix 23:15-03:00

## The Union website is bad and I'm confused

I understand, **[message us on Facebook](http://m.me/computingsoc)** and we'll help you out.

**We'll see you at 7pm, at Hari's bar**
