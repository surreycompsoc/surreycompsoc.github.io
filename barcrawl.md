Come along to our next barcrawl, in 3 simple steps!

## Step 1: Buy a ticket!

Tickets are Â£7, and include access to all venues (including Citrus at Rubix!) and a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks deals.

To purchase, go to the **[Union 'Buy Products' page (link here)](https://www.ussu.co.uk/activity/Pages/BuyProducts.aspx)**. Their site is notoriously bad on mobile, so maybe get to a PC to avoid pulling your hair out. Log in, and find the 'CompSoc Refresh Barcrawl', add it by pressing the '>' button, and pay securely.

If you get any errors, or the Union website is otherwise playing up, **[message us on Facebook](http://m.me/computingsoc)** and we'll be happy to help you.

## Step 2: Tell us your shirt size!

Use **[this Google form (link)](https://goo.gl/forms/avZ1qZR0C3Gj1EI63)** to tell us your size, so we can order you the right shirt. Shirts can be collected the day before the crawl (along with voucher books for 'spoons)

## Step 3: RSVP on Facebook!

If you haven't already, head to our **[Facebook event (link)](https://www.facebook.com/events/2040169739535382/)** and mark that you're going!

## Where are we going?

Here's the plan:

* Hari's Bar 19:00-19:45
* Spoons 20:00-21:00
* Pews 21:15-22:00
* TBC 22:15-23:00
* Rubix 23:15-02:00

**We'll see you at 7pm, at Hari's bar**
