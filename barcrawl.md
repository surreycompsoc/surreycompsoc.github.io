**Coming up:** Our Finale Barcrawl!

Following our **[AGM](/agm)**, we're having one final barcrawl before the new committee takes over! We hope you'll come along.

This one's **fancy dress**! It's 'May the Fourth' so maybe you want to go as a Star Wars character, but anything goes! The winner receives a alcoholic pitcher in spoons, or two pints of a soft drink of your choice.

## Step 1: Buy a ticket!

Tickets are £4.50 online (or £5 cash), and include access to all venues (including Flirt at Rubix!) and a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks deals.

To purchase, go to the **[Union 'Buy Products' page (link here)](https://www.ussu.co.uk/activity/Pages/BuyProducts.aspx)**. Their site is notoriously bad on mobile, so maybe get to a PC to avoid pulling your hair out. Log in, and find the 'CompSoc Finale Barcrawl', add it by pressing the '>' button, and pay securely.

If you get any errors, or the Union website is otherwise playing up, **[message us on Facebook](http://m.me/computingsoc)** and we'll be happy to help you.

## Step 2: RSVP on Facebook!

If you haven't already, head to our **[Facebook event (link)](https://www.facebook.com/events/2060357857575601/)** and mark that you're going!

## Step 3: Turn up!

We'll give out wristbands at our AGM or in Hari's on the night, whenever we see you.

## Where are we going?

Here's the plan:

* Hari's Bar 18:30-19:30 (Arrive before 7 for Happy Hour drinks deals!)
* Spoons 19:45-20:45
* Pews 21:00-21:45
* Popworld 22:00-23:00
* Rubix 23:15-03:00

**We'll see you at 6.30pm, at Hari's bar**

*- Your CompSoc committee*
