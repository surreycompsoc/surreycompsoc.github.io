We are the **University of Surrey Computing Society**, or **CompSoc**. We host academic events in the field of Computer Science, organising and managing professional events around our field, and social events primarily for CompSci students to have fun.

[**Click here to join us, it's free!**](/join/)

If you'd like to interact with us, the best bet is to message our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ComputingSoc). We'd be happy to answer any questions you have about our society, or indeed about Computer Science at Surrey. You can also get in touch with us about opportunities for our Society to get involved with.
