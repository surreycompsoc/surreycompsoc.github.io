Thank you for considering joining CompSoc!

It's **free** for all Surrey students to join, and here's how!

1. Click through to the [**USSU Get Memberships**](https://www.ussu.co.uk/activity/Pages/GetMemberships.aspx) page.
2. Log into your account.
3. Add CompSoc membership (and any other memberships you like, there are some great ones).
4. Press 'Pay' (if you only add free memberships, this won't cost you anything).

If you go back to the page again, you should see 'CompSoc' in your 'My Memberships' list.
