Our Society aims to run academic and social events throughout the year that will interest CompSci students as well as other students with an interest in computer science. You can view upcoming events here, or on our [Facebook page](https://facebook.com/ComputingSoc).

If you want to pitch ideas for events we should run, get in touch! [Drop an email](mailto:ussu.computing@surrey.ac.uk) or hit us up on [Messenger](https://m.me/ComputingSoc).
